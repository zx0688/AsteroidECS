The project was implemented using a my custom-built simple ECS where a GameObject is used as "Entity" to demonstrate my program skill and understanding ECS pattern.

Collision system is not the best, it uses circle-line intersection algorithm wich is not the most optimal.

Entry point is Core class
There is a gif animation bellow, have to wait a little bit to see it.

Space - fire

Left/Right/Up/Down - control

L - laser
